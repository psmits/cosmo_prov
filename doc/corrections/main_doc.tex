\maketitle

It was recently brought to the author's attention a series of errors in the body mass data recorded in Supplementary Dataset 1 of \citep{Smits2015} which were then included in that analysis. These errors took two forms: 1) improperly back-transforming body mass data from SMIT ET AL 2004, and 2) incorrectly inserting the measurement of the part used to estimate body mass into the body mass column for the ``PBDB + regression'' observations. The first error affects 24 of 1936 observations while the second affects approximately 1000 of the observations.

The first error was due to the body mass data recorded in SMITH ET AL 2004 being recorded in log base 10 units and not in natual log units; I made the mistake and back-transformed raising \(e\) to that power instead of 10. This was my honest mistake and has since been corrected NEW SUPPLEMENT.

The second error was also the product of a minor coding mistake. In the code for processing body mass data from all the different sources, those which are processed as ``PBDB + regression'' have an intermediate step with four columns; I used the incorrect column call which caused this error. Like the first, this error was my honest mistake and I have since corrected it NEW SUPPLEMENT.

An archive of the original, uncorrected code is avaliable at http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.44365. An archive of the new, corrected code is avaliable at URL DOI. The errors take place in file R/body\_size.r on lines 48-49 and 160-161, respectively. No other code changes were necessary to correct these errors.


I have since re-run the original analysis of \citep{Smits2015} with the updated and corrected body mass estimates. 

% my guess is that only the estimate of the effect of body size could change
% because predictors are treated as independent
% however, have to wait and see
% might affect size the time and/or phylogeny contributions
