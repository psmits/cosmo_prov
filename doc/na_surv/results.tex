\section{Results}
% \hat{R} values indicate approximate convergence of all chains for all parameter estimates.
% The table is for key parameters of interest.
% Given these estimated parameter values, how well does my model fit?
%   Deviance residuals indicate the major problem is over estimation of duration.
%   However, there residuals are not oddly shaped, approximately good fit for the mean.
%   Comparison of empirical survival to 100 estimates shows pretty good congruence.
%   Corroborated with comparison of empirical point estimates with simulated distributions.
% The model seems a pretty good descriptor of expected duration.
% Interpretation of parameter estimates.
%   Diet and locomotor categories and probability state X lives longer than state Y.
%   Mass has small effect of increase in mass associated with an expected increase in duration.
%   Occupancy has largest effect, as expected given how often it has been identified.
%   Cohort
%     Evidence of weak effect of younger cohorts surviving longer than older cohorts.
%     However, effect has low overall variance, indicating cohorts are mostly similar.
%   Phylogeny
%     Non-zero effect, though small. Probably why ``phylo signal'' not found.
%     Slightly greater overall variance than cohort
%   VPC
%     Individual species variance is largest source of unexplained variance.
%     Phylogeny then cohort.

  \caption{Deviance residuals from the fitted survival model. Each graph depicts the residuals from single draws from the posteriors distributions of all estimated parameters. Positive values indicate an under estimate of the observed duration, while negative values indicate an over estimate of the observed duration. Twelve difference examples are provided here to indicate the lack of individual observation based biases.}

  \caption{Comparison between K-M estimate of survival function (black) from the observed versus K-M estimates from 100 simulated data sets using the fitted model (dark grey). Simulated data sets were generated by drawing parameter values randomly from their estimated posteriors and using the observed covariate information to estimate durations for all the observed species. On the left are the results from the full survival model (Fig. \ref{fig:model_diagram}), while on the right are the results from a simplified model where duration follows an exponential distribution and there is no phylogenetic effect.}

Comparisons of locomotor categories, from top to bottom (\subref{subfig:loco}), are: arboreal versus ground dwelling, arboreal versus scansorial, and ground dwelling versus scansorial. For dietary category, from top to bottom (\subref{subfig:diet}): carnivore versus herbivore, carnivore versus insectivore, carnivore versus omnivore, herbivore versus insectivore, herbivore versus omnivore, and insectivore versus omnivore.
