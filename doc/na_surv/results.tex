\section{Results}
% \hat{R} values indicate approximate convergence of all chains for all parameter estimates.
% The table is for key parameters of interest.
% Given these estimated parameter values, how well does my model fit?
%   Deviance residuals indicate the major problem is over estimation of duration.
%   However, there residuals are not oddly shaped, approximately good fit for the mean.
%   Comparison of empirical survival to 100 estimates shows pretty good congruence.
%   Corroborated with comparison of empirical point estimates with simulated distributions.
% The model seems a pretty good descriptor of expected duration.

With all marginal posterior estimates having converged (\(\hat{R} < 1.1\)) it is possible be examine the quality of model fit (Table \ref{tab:post_sum}). If the model is an adequate descriptor of the observed data, then relatively confident inference can be made \citep{Gelman2013d}.

Visual examination of the deviance residuals from twelve different sets of posterior predictive simulations indicates few systematic problems (Fig. \ref{fig:ppc_res}). The only concern is that the residuals are slightly skewed, however this bias appears very small. This is confirmed by comparing the K-M estimate of the empirical survival function to 100 estimated survival functions from posterior simulations (Fig. \ref{fig:ppc_surv}).

Comparisons of the observed 25th, 50th, 75th quantiles, and mean durations to the results from the posterior predictive simulations indicate adequate model fit (Fig. \ref{fig:ppc_quant}). Because all the different posterior predictive checks seem to agree, the inferred model appears adequate at capturing the observed variation.

% Interpretation of parameter estimates.
%   Diet and locomotor categories and probability state X lives longer than state Y.
%   Occupancy has largest effect, as expected given how often it has been identified.
%   Mass has weakly positive effect on duration. 
%   Cohort
%     Evidence of weak effect of younger cohorts surviving longer than older cohorts.
%     However, effect has low overall variance, indicating cohorts are mostly similar.
%   Phylogeny
%     Non-zero effect, though small. Probably why ``phylo signal'' not found.
%     Slightly greater overall variance than cohort
%   VPC
%     Individual species variance is largest source of unexplained variance.
%     cohort >= phylo
%     However, cohort + phylo approx. 20\% of the unexplained variance.
%     Not ignorable effects.

Given that the model appears adequate, it is possible to interpret the parameter estimates with some degree of confidence. The estimates for diet and locomotor categories were inferred as contrasts between the intercept and one of the \(k - 1\) other states (Table \ref{tab:post_sum}). In order to interpret these estimates, I compared the differences between each of the different states to get an estimate of whether either of two traits was associated with a greater mean duration or not. This was done for all pairwise comparisons for diet and locomotor category separately (Fig. \ref{fig:trait_est}).

Dietary category has a large amount of variation in the pairwise differences of the effect on expected duration (Fig. \ref{subfig:loco}). Carnivory appears to be associated with a greater expected duration than herbivory or insectivory, while approximately equal to or less than the expected duration of an omnivore. Omnivory is associated with greater expected duration than either herbivory or insectivory. Finally, herbivory and insectivory are associated with approximately equal effects on expected duration.

For locomotor category, arboreality appears to be associated with a lower expected duration than either scansoriality or a ground dwelling life habit (Fig. \ref{subfig:diet}). Scansoriality and a ground dwelling life habit have approximately equal expected durations. % percentile differences.

The effects of both body size and bioprovince occupancy on expected duration are best interpreted from estimates from the model fit standardized data (Fig. \ref{fig:eff_other}). Of all the traits of interest, bioprovince occupancy has the largest effect size with larger occupancy associated with a longer expected duration. Body size has a very small, near zero effect on expected duration, similar to the lack of relationship between body size and generic duration \citep{Tomiya2013}.

The estimates for the individual cohort effects show a weak pattern of increased extinction risk in older Cenozoic cohorts and decreased extinction risk in younger cohorts (Fig. \ref{fig:eff_cohort}). However, this pattern is not very strong as there is a large amount of variation, particularity for older cohorts. For example, note the two cohorts between 50 and 55 My that have a much lower extinction risk than other cohorts of similar age. However, it is interesting to note that the apparent shift from older cohorts with a higher extinction risk to younger cohorts with lower extinction risk is approximately 30 Mya or the Paleogene--Neogene boundary. This transition is marked by the opening up of the landscape and the rise of grazers and the decline heavily forested environments.

Because the estimate of the Weibull shape parameter, \(\alpha\), is greater than 1 extinction risk is expected to increase with taxon age (Table \ref{tab:post_sum}). The estimate of \(\alpha\) is also rather tightly constrained, having a small posterior standard deviation. \(\alpha\) is related to the strength of time on extinction risk and is a key parameter in the hazard function \(h(t)\) (Eq. \ref{eq:wei_haz}). As stated previously \(h(t)\) can be interpreted as the rate, or approximate probability, of an individual of age \(t\) going extinct. As the value of \(\alpha\) is between 1 and 1.5, extinction risk for a given species only gradually increases with age (Fig. \ref{fig:haz}). 

% variance partitioning coefficient
Of the three sources of variance present in the model, variation in individual species accounts for approximately 70\% of observed variance (Fig. \ref{fig:vpc}). Both cohort and phylogenetic effects account for the other 30\% of the observed variance. Both of these factors are related to some aspect of the relationship between taxa, either temporal and through shared evolutionary history. While both of these effects are the source of approximately 15\% of observed variance individually, the total combined effect of these factors indicates that neither can be ignored. For example, \citet{Housworth2004} state that when phylogenetic heritability is greater than 0, phylogenetic effect cannot be ignored. As \(VPC_{phylo}\) is equivalent to phylogenetic heritability and is greater than 0, the effect of shared evolutionary history on duration is non-ignorable.

The low amount of variance of phylogenetic effect estimated from the model (Table \ref{tab:post_sum}) may explain previously found lack of ``significant phylogenetic signal'' in generic duration \citep{Tomiya2013}.
