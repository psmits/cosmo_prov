\section{Introduction}

Extinction is the second most important aspect of diversification, after only speciation. Why species go extinct at different rates remains one of the most fundamental questions in paleobiology \citep{Simpson1944,VanValen1973,Raup1991b,Raup1994,Quental2013,Wagner2014b,Jablonski2005,Payne2007,Kitchell1986}. Determining which and how biological traits influence extinction risk is vital for understanding the differential diversification of life during the Phanerozoic and making predictions about species' vulnerability to anthropogenic impacts. Yet investigations into the factors that affect extinction rate have proved inconclusive and often contradictory results.


The fossil record of North American mammals is well resolved and represents an ideal data set to model long term evolutionary patterns \citep{Quental2013,Alroy2009,Alroy1996a,Alroy1998,Alroy2000g,Simpson1944,Blois2009,Tomiya2013,Marcot2014}.

Van Valen proposed the Law of Constant Extinction \citep{VanValen1973} which states that the instantaneous rate of extinction for a taxon is independent of it's age. 

Background extinction, or extinction occurring \textbf{not} at mass extinctions, is generally considered complicated with many more potential factors influencing the instantaneous extinction risk of any given species \citep{Jablonski1986,Wang2003,Harnik2013,Kitchell1986,Nurnberg2013a,Payne2007}. Factors such as geographic range have well known effects on survival \citep{Payne2007,Jablonski1987} because the effect size is large and thus easy to identify for a given sample size. The between extinction risk and other traits, specifically organismal ones, are less well known because they most likely have much smaller effect sizes which makes identification and inference difficult.

Here I take a Bayesian hierarchical survival model approach for understanding the effects of organismal and species traits, time of origination, and shared evolutionary history on species duration. This is a direct extension of the more traditional dynamic and cohort survival analyses from paleontology \citep{Simpson1944,VanValen1973,Foote1988,Raup1978,Raup1975,VanValen1979,Baumiller1993,Sepkoski1975}.

The organismal and species traits studied here are biogeographic occupancy, body mass, and both dietary and locomotor categories. This is a mixture of well established factors that potentially influencing extinction risk (i.e. occupancy and body mass) and less well understood ones (i.e. dietary and locomotor categories). Dietary category is of particular interest as it has been shown to influence diversification rate \citep{Price2012} though because of the limitations of many phylogenetic comparative methods it is unknown if this is due to differences in speciation, extinction, or both \citep{Rabosky2010a}.
