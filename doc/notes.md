-------------

-  hierarchical bayesian survival model for ungulates and ungulate likes
   -  good option for dealing with the south american fossil stuff
      (Meridungulata). there are three groups (Notoungulata, Liptoterna,
      Pyrotheria).

-  hierarchical bayesian survival model with a "mixing" hyperprior on frailty.
    -  normal dist? use as measure of how similar the phylogenetic effect is
       between clades
