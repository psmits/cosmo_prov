Analysis of Mammalian Survival and Distribution
===============================================

Species survival
----------------

Death and Taxa: influence of biological, temporal, and historical factors on mammal extinction risk.

Biological factors
-  dietary category (carnivore, herbivore, insectivore, omnivore)
-  locomotor category (arboreal, ground dwelling, scansorial)
-  body size
-  mean relative bioprovince occupancy

Temporal factor
-  origination cohort random effect

Historical factor
-  phylogenetic covariance random effect

Fully Bayesian survival model.

North America with goals to include Europe and South America.
